# My First Medical Accompaniment Experience

I'm Amy, a university student volunteer who just joined iMigo. Last week, I accompanied Sari from Indonesia to see a doctor for the first time.

## Preparation

Before departing, I prepared by:
- Learning basic medical terminology
- Understanding Sari's symptoms
- Preparing relevant medical translation apps

## The Experience

Although nervous, seeing Sari's relieved smile made it all worthwhile. The doctor was patient, and we successfully completed the consultation.

## Reflection

This experience taught me that volunteer service isn't just about helping others, it's a process of mutual learning and growth.
